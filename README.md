# Perceptual and Cognitive Neuroscience (PCN) Laboratory
This repository hosts the virtual reality code I am creating for the Perceptual and Cognitive Neuroscience (PCN) Laboratory at Mississippi State University.

"The PCN lab, led by Dr. Michael Pratte, is part of the Psychology Department and the Institute for Imaging and Analytical Technologies at Mississippi State University. We study human behavior and brain activity, in an effort to better understand how the human brain is so good at perceiving, remembering, and later recognizing information in the world."
More information about the research done in the PCN Lab can be found [here](http://pcn.psychology.msstate.edu/).

## About Me
I am an undergraduate research assistant in the PCN lab. I am majoring in Computer Science and pursuing a minor in Cognitive Science because I am really interested in the mind and human-computer interaction.

## Virtual Reality & Cognitive Science
I am working under the direction of Dr. Pratte to transfer current 2D experiments into a 3D interactive environment through an Oculus Rift VR system.

## Languages & Technologies Used
* Oculus Rift
* MATLAB
* Psychtoolbox
